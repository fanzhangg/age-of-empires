# Introduction

This is the website for my capstone project. Due to the competitive and coorperative nature of esport, the network of esport matches might reveal interesting strucutres and properties. In this project, I create a complex network based on the matched of Age of Empires II on Voobly. I want to see how the matching system, the design of the game, and the way that players play the game shape the network.

### Tentative Research Questions

* General Structures
  * What is the network's structure? Does it follow the power law? Does it obey a heavy-tailed distribution?
  * Does it well-connected? Can we divide the network into several components? Does it have high amounts of clustering?
* Centrality
  * Does high centrality vertices correspond to top players?
  * Is there some common feature of players with high centrality scores \(Total matches, civilization, map\)?
* Community
  * Does different community share a common feature? \(Map, Civilization\)
  * Does the community reveal some features of the way player plays the game? For instance, each community has a different dominant map type. This suggests players may specialize in one type, or each map is suitable for players with different ranks.
